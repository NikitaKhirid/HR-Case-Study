# HR-Case-Study
HR case study with Classification & Deep learning

Aim:- The objective of this project is to classify whether employee has to be promoted or not.

Information:- Dataset consists of several employee Variables(Independent) and one Outcome Variable(Dependent) We used different classification algorithm and deep learning.Based on RandomSearchCv method use for hyperparameter. Data set is imbalanced we have to do it balance. Used different performance matrix for performance measures,But we consider accuracy score for conclusion because of accuracy is a better metric when there are balanced classes as in the our case.

Conclusion:- I have achieved a very weak accuracy with 77% by our Naive Bayes model. So we conclude from different algorithm that Bagging is best algorithm with 97% accuracy for this problem with given dataset.
